                At Paylogic we have enjoyed having our Django-based event ticket platform under continuous integration for a while. Now we would like to be able to deploy (easily!) as often as we want, so we are working on setting up everything necessary to get it under continuous deployment. I have been researching how other companies have done it (Django-based or not) and I would like to share my findings regarding:<br /><br />- Do you need Continuous Deployment? (and what is it, actually?)<br />- What you need.<br />- Common ways to deploy and rollback.<br />- What are the most common problems in setting up Continuous Deployment for Python applications and what to do about them.<br />- How we do it.<br />- Recipes (for example, how to slowly roll out features).

                One of the big changes in Django 1.3 was the introduction of Class-Based Views. Class-Based Views represent one of the biggest stylistic changes in Django since Magic Removal, and there's been lots of confusion surrounding them.<br /><br />This talk will be a brief tutorial, providing some background and dispelling some of the confusion around the use of Class-Based Views. It will also look at some interesting possibilities that are made possible by the use of the class-based view framework.

                With most frameworks the ORM attempts to treat all databases equally, this results in developers being limited in how many advantages they can take of their database. In particular Postgres has many features which developers would love to take advantage of but are not easily accessible via the Django ORM.

                As software developers, the world of hardware can seem confusing but alluring. Small computers are now cheap enough that useful products can be built for less than $100. But the real value from the Internet of Things comes from networking. In this talk, I'll introduce you to basic hardware hacking, and show you how Web, mobile and microcontroller technologies can be brought together using Django—with surprising and playful results.

                In the world of programming nothing is more irritating than the "artist". Programmers who are all "front-end", business guys who are all "ideas", and designers who can't draw.  I say real programmers don't need to be artists. Rather, a programmer needs to have the skills necessary to take their imagination (or other people's) and translate it into working software.<br /><br />This talk will contain many of my secrets for turning ideas I have in my mind into real things.  I will lean heavily on the arts, music, and writing, but ultimately this talk will be about implementing software.  There will be no fluffy spirituality or hand waving in this talk, just real tricks to help you make stuff.

                There are many idioms and patterns that used to be a best practice but isn't anymore, thanks to changes in Python. Despite that they often show up even in new code, and some of these patterns are even explained to be Good Ideas at stackoverflow and similar. <br /><br />This talk will bring out the most common of these patterns so you know what they are, and why you should avoid them.

                For many years before 2012, the topic at the tip of every argument-seeking tongue at Django Conferences was ""when is Django going to get on Github?"" Getting the core framework on the social coding site was the first stride in breaking down the barriers to having anyone and everyone not only having a pony, but getting it into core too. Now that this important step is almost a year in, just how easy is it to take the step from end-user to core-contributor? Delightfully Easy.<br /><br />So easy, that I'll be breaking every rule I know in giving a talk and actually attempting to get a feature from idea, to code, to request, to a live haggle-and-debate session with core contributors in-audience, to pull request to (hopefully!) merge all within 30 minutes. Advice from a variety previous contributors on will be provided throughout the demonstration, including tips for getting very small bugs fixed quickly to strategies for getting necessary groundswell for larger full-feature ideas.

I've stumbled upon many of them while developing a highly distributed system at SetJam and then Motorola Mobility and want to share my experiences with you. Knowing how to properly route queries, migrate schemas (using lovely South library) and then test the whole thing, while dodging chainsaws of Multi-DB API, will probably save you a few days of cursing.<br /><br />Just to ignite your curiosity: Did you remember to set `_for_write`correctly in all methods of your custom `QuerySet`?

                Django has been built on the assumption to have upfront static data models; i.e. the developer implements them completely before deployment. However, there are numerous real-world uses cases that require to have dynamic models that can be created and amended by users or some kind of user actions. Examples could be: customizable products for a shop, unique content types to represent web site content in a CMS or online surveys that are created on the fly. <br /><br />There are various conceptual options to solve this problem. The most prominent ones are: a) Entity Attribute Value Models, b) Pickeld Fields and Pickeld Models, c) Database DDL operations at run-time  Most of which have been discussed intensively and the Django community has developed numerous apps. I will compare the various approaches and apps in terms of usability, speed, features, sweet spots and preferred use cases. This will support any future evaluation for a specific project. But it will hopefully also trigger a fruitful community discussion on the importance of this feature for Django in comparison with other applications and frameworks like Zope/Plone, Magento etc.

Python boasts nearly 30,000 contributed packages listed on PyPI and that number is growing every day.  Within those packages, there are inevitably a bunch of duplicates (packages that solve the same problem).  What makes developers choose one over another?  Why do some packages go nearly unused and some have cult-like followings?

                I go through the various tools and techniques that we use to make our Django apps easily reusable across sites and environments with different requirements on data being stored, business logic and backends that enable us to have one set of apps that we deploy over and over and just easily plug in the part that is different in each case without sacrificing clarity or ease of development.<br /><br />All tools and approaches are used in production and are open source.
