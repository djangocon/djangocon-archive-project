                <p>I'm a Python geek and I work as a software architect at Paylogic, a boldly growing ticketing platform in the Netherlands. I come from Catalonia, a nation that (like HTTP) does not have a state. Maybe this is what made a developer of me. As a child I started with dBase III and x86 assembler, and after having spent many years writing Java for banks and PHP payment processors for the porn industry I moved North and switched to the challenging fun of Python and event peak sales. When I'm not coding or designing software I'm biking around on my recumbent bike or desecrating old master's works on my piano.</p>

Before Django, Andy worked on Plone and wrote a book about it, but thats not as cool anymore. Conversations normally revolve around curling, skiing, maple syrup, igloos and other great things from Canada. But not ice hockey.</p>

                <p>Marc works as backend developer for allink, a brand and web agency located in Zurich. He is finishing his part time studies in computer science this summer and is constantly trying to push the limits of Django. In his spare time he likes to fly all sorts of remote controlled gadgets.</p>

                <p>Jérémie is a frontend developer for the Zurich based brand and web agency allink. While studying computer science part time, he is happy to have dropped PHP years ago. Whenever he has some time left, he enjoys playing soccer or flying quadcopters.</p>

                <p>Juergen felt in love with Python and Django about 4 years ago. He likes to crunch data and build interesting web applications. Lately, he started at <a href="http://reliatec.de/">reliatec.de</a> to do exactly that with Django and develop reliable web based health systems.</p>

                <p>Marek fell in love with Django back in 2007, when he dumped PHP and wrote WolneLektury.pl using the web framework. Shortly after he joined SetJam and lived through three acquisitions (Motorola Mobility, Google and then Arris). Today Marek maintains a distributed application written over 3 years in Python/Django, coorganizes Warsaw programmer meetups (Djangobeer) and teaches women how to program at Django Carrots. When not in front of the computer, he is probably running.</p>

                <p>Jacob Burch has created websites since he was 12 years old. After spending his high school years as co-Editor in Chief of his high schook's website, he decided to finish his college studies and pursue the highly lucrative major of American Literature at UCLA. After graduating, Jacob decided the paparazzi-laden world of fame and fortune found in literative criticism was too much for him, so he returned to his humble programming roots as an software engineer at <a href="http://Mahalo.com" rel="nofollow">Mahalo.com</a>. After serving time as Director of Technology and CTO at Mahalo, Jacob joined Revolution Systems as an Engineer in 2011. He blogs with random frequency at <a href="http://blog.jacobburch.com" rel="nofollow">http://blog.jacobburch.com</a></p>

                <p>I've been programming for over 10 years in various languages. Python is by far my favorite language. I have an unhealthy obsession towards performance tuning and optimization.</p>

<p>I've given talks at DjangoCon, Utah Open Source Conference, PyCon and local user groups. I love sharing the cool stuff I learn.</p>

<p>I work on the Python instrumentation team at NewRelic where we concoct creative ways to find performance bottlenecks in Python webapps.</p>

He started using Python in 1997 or 1998 (the exact year has been lost to history) and for 15 years has maintained the PyEphem library for amateur astronomers.  He trains new Python programmers professionally and also consults on Python software projects such as the New England Wildflower Society's new Go Botany web site, which runs on Django. Brandon and his wife Jackie are living in small-town Ohio while she finishes writing her dissertation, where he enjoys being able to walk or bicycle everywhere, using the car only when it is time to drive to the airport and fly to a Python conference.</p>

                <p>Daniel Greenfeld is a developer working mostly with Python, Django, and JavaScript. He's the co-author of Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5. He is a principal at Cartwheel Web, a firm specializing in Python and Django applications.</p>

<p>Daniel first heard about Python around 1999 when the Zope Corporation contacted him about possible employment. The commute was too far, so he went for a Java position instead. After half a decade of Java work he was ready to quit programming, but was re-introduced to Python in 2005 while at NASA headquarters. By 2006 he was working full-time with Python, and in 2009 he started to work with Django. He met his fiancée, Audrey Roy, during a Django tutorial at PyCon 2010. In 2013 he was invited to speak at Django Circus.</p>

<p>Daniel believes that Python and Django have been very good for him, and is doing everything possible to pay it forward.</p>

                <p>Honza is a Python programmer and Django core developer – since he is scared of the bright and shiny world of browsers, designers, and users he prefers to stay buried deep in the infrastructure code and just provides others with tools to do the actual site-building.</p>

<p>Since 2008 Honza has been building content web sites for fun and profit. During this time he discovered Elasticsearch which lead to him joining the company behind it in 2013 to work on the Python drivers.<br /></p>
