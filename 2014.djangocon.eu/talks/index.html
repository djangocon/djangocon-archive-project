<p>Docker adds some niceties to Linux containers such as AUFS, version control, docker registry (repository), versioning etc. This talk will serve as an introduction to working with docker tools. I'll cover the basic concepts behind docker and explain the difference between a docker container and a VM. Show a demo of how easy it is to create a docker image and launch a container from it. Briefly explain the idea behind Dockerfile and show some examples.</p>
<p>I'll cover how networking and filesystem changes are handled in Docker. Show a demo of how to deploy a Django application in docker and explain why it's useful to do so in production.</p>
<p>I'll also cover some common use cases of docker in the industry such as testing, deployment, PAAS etc.  </p></div>

Gathering metrics and events in a production system lead to a better knowledge of pain points and eases troubleshooting a lot when issues arise. This talk will explain how to setup a rock-solid visibility stack for your apps, how to feed data into it and how to extract meaningful information from that data.</p>
<p>We will start with the basics of exception handling and continue with the meat of this talk consisting in two parts:</p>
<p>1 - Events (i.e., mostly logging calls)</p>
<p>An introduction to logging in large production deployments:</p>
<ul>
<li>centralized logging with logstash and elasticsearch</li>
<li>the case for structured logging</li>
<li>rich dashboards with Kibana</li>
</ul>
<p>2 - Metrics</p>
<p>An opinionated take on monitoring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Riemann, the universal metrics hub</li>
<li>simple thresholds and alerts</li>
<li>persisting metrics data to Graphite</li>
<li>Riemann and Graphite dashboards</li>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>What is the only thing that really matters?</p>
<p>We are programmers, and everything in the ideology of our industry is disembodied and virtualised. At the same time we are building the world that the rest of the world, increasingly, will live in.</p>
<p>We are, it seems, sexless selves and disembodied minds in a world that doesn't need our bodies and isn't very interested in them.</p>
<p>And yet: the body remains at the centre of the world, even this supposedly bodiless world. Its disputes and politics, its hurts and controversies, its pains and insults all belong to the body.</p>
<p>Even the fiction and film of this new world of the unbodied are (and always have been) bodily-fixated.</p>
<p>In short, there's no escaping the body.</p>
<p>In this talk, I take examples from history, literature, film, poetry and other fields to show how our present state can be woven into a very ancient pattern, and ask: what should we, as programmers, do about it?</p>
<p>And finally, I make a modest attempt to answer that question.</p></div>

                        <p>During his childhood Harry seemed to be doing everything right -- learning to program BASIC on Thomson TO-7s (whose rubber keys went "boop" when you pressed them) and Logo on a Green-screen Amstrad PCW. Something went wrong as he grew up, and Harry wasted several years studying Economics, becoming a management consultant (shudder), and programming little aside from overcomplicated Excel spreadsheets.</p>
<p>But in 2009 Harry saw the light, let his true geek shine once again, did a new degree in Computer Science, and was lucky enough to secure an internship with Resolver Systems, the London-based company that has since morphed into PythonAnywhere.

<p>In this talk I will outline a (controversial) thesis: that such tests are just not very useful in the world of web application development, and Django.  Given that my opinion is so wrong-headed (or maybe just plain wrong), I will endeavour to provide a balanced picture of the pros and cons of different testing approaches, including the arguments for purist unit tests, the options for integration testing and acceptance testing, the "functional core imperative shell" pattern (AKA hexagon architecture), all with a view to leaving the audience informed enough to make their own decisions about testing strategy.</p></div>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>Oliver Reichenstein famously quipped that “The Web is 95% Typography.” Most of the information we take in on the web is textual in nature. It behooves us, as writers and curators of text, to know about the art and science of presenting textual information.</p>
<p>This talk isn’t about art, or science, but technique. Typesetting has a rich history, dating back to Mr. Gutenberg and his printing press. Although digital type is fairly mature by now, type on the web is still very much in its infancy. We are only now gaining typographical controls that the publishing industry has taken for granted these last 20 years. I'll be taking you on tour of the current state of type on the web: what we can do today, and what we will be able to do tomorrow.</p>

<em> A reintroduction to font-face and the nitty-gritty details of how it works
</em> Advanced typography with CSS3 font-features (http://caniuse.com/#feat=font-feature)
<em> Icon fonts, and semantic use thereof

                    <div class="abstract"><p>Delivering high quality software solutions that meet customer expectations and requirements is the essential goal of any development project. Therefore, development teams need to obtain the relevant domain knowledge and information from their customers.</p>
<p>As a result, initial system specifications are typically formulated using natural language (e.g., within plain text documents). The main challenge imposed by this process is to avoid misunderstandings, misinterpretations and inconsistencies during the transformation of informal requirements into formal specifications, models, and executable code or tests.</p>
<p>At first the talk will briefly introduce Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) as a powerful method to bridge the gap between requirements engineering and software testing.
Following this, the second part will push the original ATDD idea even further by introducing the concept of “Lean Modeling”, a lightweight and pragmatic alternative to classical software modeling and DSL tools.</p>
<p>Examples will be presented that illustrate the usage of natural language specifications for various django specific artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>models</li>
<li>REST Resources</li>
<li>initial database data (fixtures)</li>
<li>forms.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach can also help to improve our debugging experience and IDE smart completion support. In addition to these advantages during development a demo will be shown, that illustrates how customers / users can benefit from “Lean Modeling” by creating custom forms in their django backend with natural language.</p></div>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>Django intentionally has been designed as a pure server side framework, thus being agnostic about client side programming, except for the Django admin interface, which uses jQuery.
Letting developers choose their preferred client side framework has been a wise decision by Django community. However, in most cases the de-facto standard, hence jQuery, is used. In the past years, other Javascript frameworks have emerged, namely Knockout, EmberJS, Backbone and AngularJS. They all attempt to circumvent to shortcomings of jQuery.
Since Django developers are familiar with the concept of Model-View-Control, they might feel even more comfortable with one of these frameworks, rather than with jQuery.</p>
<p>In my proposed talk, I would like to give a short introduction into AngularJS’s two-way data-binding, which can dramatically reduce boilerplate code, otherwise required when using jQuery.
Furthermore, this talk will handle the following topics:
- How to render model-bound forms for AngularJS, using mixin classes to be added to the built in Django form.
- How Django’s form validation can be used to pre-validate the form data on the client, using the AngularJS Model controller, but without duplicating code.
- How to securely call Django view’s methods from inside an AngularJS controller, with a behaviour similar to remote procedure calls.
- How to use dependency injection to separate concern for external data, either created by Django for production use, or by a mocking class when writing unit tests for browsers code.
- Three-way data-binding build on top of AngularJS’s two-way data-binding using websockets for bidirectional synchronization of the browsers view model with server side data buckets.</p>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>All too often we see developers and system operators fail to communicate. Both teams seems to have different requirements: developers want new features and releases whilst operators want stable systems. But the fact of the matter is that both teams have the same goals. When both teams are brought together from the get-go, you notice the goals become visible again and the requirements align. </p>
<p>The Devops movement in IT  is a critical mass of developers and IT operations aligning their ideas. It is a collection of best practices, tooling and a philophy that emphasizes on collaboration and automation. But the most important best practice a developer and IT operator requires is the art of clear and concise communication.</p>
<p>In this talk, I'll finally remove the confusion of what Devops really is and explain the best practices and toolsets. The talk revolves around the CALMS acronym:</p>
<ul>
<li>Culture: people and process first, if you dont have the correct culture, all attempts will be fruitless. </li>
<li>Automation: remove the human error from the equation. </li>
<li>Lean: learn to adapt to situations, think outside the box and identify processes that are a waste of time</li>
<li>Measurements: If you can't measure, you can't identify and improve. Performance metrics, process metrics and even people metrics!</li>
<li>Sharing: This is the loopback in the CALMS cycle. Share your ideas and solutions with the community. Learn from the advise of other people and improve your own processes along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your product is more than the application, it is also the monitoring, the infrastructure, the constant improvement, the sharing of knowledge and the people developing it!</p></div>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>Are you a Django novice, confused by words like class-based views, URL dispatchers, HTTP requests? Are you still wondering how to use all those things to build the pages of your Web site?</p>
<p>Django programmers that started with versions prior to 1.3 are used to deal with views as functions, and they learned how to process even complex forms in a procedural way. From the release 1.3, Django introduced class-based views (CBVs) and ported its powerful generic views to this new paradigm (class-based generic views, or CBGVs).</p>
<p>This change, however, has not been harmless for Django novices: the django-users mailing list and StackOverflow are full of questions about views and classes.</p>
<p>This talk aims to lead Django novices to a good understanding of what class-based functions are and how they can be effectively used.</p>
<p>The main topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Python classes: how OOP concepts improve the View part of Django MVT. This part aims to introduce Python classes as data processors and explains how OOP concepts like inheritance help the fast development of customized solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL dispatchers: how Django CBV process URL parameters. Here I discuss how Django class-based views store arguments extracted from URLs and how we can access them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HTTP verbs: how Django CBV deal with GET, POST and friends. This part shows what happens to a class-based view when HTTP requests are processed and how to leverage the mechanism to customize data processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CRUD operations through Django generic class-based views. Create, Read, Update, Delete are the fundamentals operations you need on data, so it is worth learning to use and customize the powerful generic views of Django that implement them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The target of this talk are Django novices who completed and understood the Django tutorial. Previous knowledge of the basic Python OOP syntax and concepts is preferred (classes, inheritance, method overriding, function arguments processing).</p></div>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>While User Experience Design (UXD) may seem like another buzzword, it actually has deep roots in usability, visual design, information architecture, and many other areas that developers and the like may already be familiar with. UXD is not just another process, but instead a way of thinking and collaborating that should not be overlooked for cost or time reasons. </p>
<p>As companies continue to put more pressure on their employees to do more with less, decision makers, product managers and developers are looking for ways to solve problems quickly, while still getting high value for the company and their customers. With changing technologies, strategies and markets, and a constant push for employees to wear multiple hats and work more collaboratively, having an amazing user experience is becoming a "must have" for companies that want to remain competitive. </p>
<p>Developers, product managers and decision makers who are new to UXD and curious to learn more will walk away with a clear definition of User Experience Design, a knowledge of its goals and the basic components that make up a UX project, such as: User Research, UI Design, Front End Development, and Content Strategy. Attendees will also walk away with examples of how UXD can add value to a project for both the business and the users. </p></div>

                        <p>Ustun Ozgur is a polyglot software developer living in Turkey. He is the lead
developer at SellerCrowd, a NY-based startup whose main product is a growing
Django project with tens of Django apps and dozens of models. His main
interests are Django, JavaScript and Clojure.</p>
<p>Inspired by the functional programming and Clojure community and specifically
Rich Hickey, he is constantly seeking ways to introduce better programming
paradigms into his daily work and combat complexity. He is equally well-versed
in the client-side programming, which is undergoing a major transformation in
the last few years. He believes that advances in client-side programming is
disrupting the way server-side programming is and will be done, which means
Django should either adopt as a server-side technology or fear extinction.</p>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>In the influential paper "Out of the Tarpit", Moseley and Marks argues that
"complexity is the single major difficulty in the successful development of
large scale software systems". In this talk, we will analyze the major sources
of "accidental" complexity a Django project faces over time, and what the
major methods to deal with them are. The major tools we have in reducing
complexity are reducing state and increasing abstraction skills.</p>
<p>The talk will start with generally accepted methods in Django software
development and touch on separating a project into multiple apps, relying on
managers to implement collection level functionality, making use of decorators
for cross-cutting concerns and adding methods to models (but bewaring the
perils of fat models). We will discuss how to separate the roles of models 
with mixins so that functionality can be reused across models. We will discuss
how functional programming techniques can be employed in a Django project to
reduce complexity.</p>
<p>In the second part of the talk, we will continue with another major source of
complexity in Django applications: The JavaScript problem. No longer can we
ignore JavaScript when discussing web projects and that covers Django too. We
will briefly see how popular tools such as jQuery, Backbone and Angular try to
solve this with increasing degrees of success, but do not attack the "state"
problem as the major source of complexity. We will introduce Facebook's React
library as the solution and how its functional programming inspired philosophy helps us to
cope with this problem. We will show how this library can be used within
Django in conjunction with a node.js renderer, whereby duplication of
templates on server and client-side, a major source of complexity is reduced.</p></div>

                    <div class="abstract"><p>Django is by far one of the best frameworks to build web applications. However, it suffers from the lack of efficient tools to create good front-ends. So, we often end up writing a lot of ad-hoc codes without any methodology, and using a ton of ready-to-use libraries. Alas, this way of designing front-ends is a terrible idea and we need to engineer these things properly.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will introduce you to the core concepts of web components and their suitability in modern web applications. Then, I will show you the methodology to build them and the tools that you need to use. Finally, I will describe you the process to integrate them into a Django project.</p></div>
